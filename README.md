# MCP Servers Rust

A collection of Model Context Protocol servers written in Rust that includes all the tools of the official or popular community MCP server.

### Why Rust?
Simply put, running several MCP servers in Rust will use less memory and compute on the host than those running in Python/Nodejs/Go runtimes.
